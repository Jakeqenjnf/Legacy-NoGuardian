<h4>Description</h4>

<p>NoGuardian is a free open-source custom Chrome extension that attempts to delete or block GoGuardian on managed Chromebooks. It is custom-made since I don't have a debit card to pay for the $5 fee to upload Chrome extensions to the web store.</p>

<h4>Credits</h4>
<p>NoGuardian is maintained by myself. I don't have anyone else working on this project, it's just me.</p>

<h4>Why this exists</h4>
<p>I created NoGuardian because of a joke in my group chat. That's it. If you were wondering, the message read "me when i hack school computers and delete goguardian:".

<h4>How to Install</h4>

<p>4.) When it finishes downloading, decompress the .zip file. Then, go to chrome://extensions in the Chrome browser, and turn on Developer Mode.</p>

<p>5.) Find the button that says "Load Unpacked" and click it. Find the folder from the .zip file. Look for the folder inside that folder that is named "extension" and import it.</p>
